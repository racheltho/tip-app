tip-app
=======

A simple iOS app to calculate tips created in under 1 hour using the [CodePath tutorial video](http://vimeo.com/102084767)

By clicking on the user input box next to "Bill Amount", a decimal keypad will come up and the user can enter the price using the keypad.
Clicking anywhere else on the screen hides the keypad.  Three different tip percentages can be selected from the segmented control.  The tip amount and total amount will automaticall update whenever the bill amount is edited or when a different tip percentage is selected.

Special features: Constraints are used and auto layout is enabled, so the placement/arrangement of the UI elements looks nice on a variety of screen sizes.
